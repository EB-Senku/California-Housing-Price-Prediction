# California-Housing-Price-Prediction

This project implements key concepts from Chapter 2 of Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow. It covers data exploration, preprocessing, and feature engineering on the California housing dataset.

I built and evaluated several models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The project also demonstrates the use of Scikit-Learn pipelines to streamline transformations and modeling steps efficiently.


This project helped deepen my understanding of machine learning workflows, model selection, and practical implementation techniques.
